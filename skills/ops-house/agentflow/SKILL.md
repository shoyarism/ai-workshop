# AgentFlow

## Overview

AgentFlow turns your existing Kanban board into a fully autonomous AI development pipeline. Instead of building custom orchestration infrastructure, it treats your project management tool (Asana, GitHub Projects, Linear) as a distributed state machine — tasks move through stages, AI agents read and write state via comments, and humans intervene through the same UI they already use.

The result is complete pipeline observability from your phone, free crash recovery (state lives in your PM tool, not in memory), and human override at any point by dragging a card.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when you need to orchestrate multiple Claude Code workers across a full development lifecycle (build, review, test, integrate)
- Use when you want deterministic quality gates (tsc/eslint/tests) before AI review on AI-generated code
- Use when you want full pipeline visibility from your Kanban board or phone
- Use when running a solo or team project that needs autonomous task dispatch with cost tracking
- Use when you need crash-proof orchestration that survives session restarts

## Core Concepts

### 7-Stage Kanban Pipeline

Tasks flow through: Backlog, Research, Build, Review, Test, Integrate, Done. Each stage has specific gates. The Kanban board IS the orchestration layer — no separate database, no message queue, no custom infrastructure.

### Stateless Orchestrator

A crontab-driven one-shot sweep runs every 15 minutes. No daemon, no session dependency. If it crashes, the next sweep picks up where it left off because all state lives in your PM tool.

### Deterministic Before Probabilistic

# Hugging Face Paper Pages

Hugging Face Paper pages (hf.co/papers) is a platform built on top of arXiv (arxiv.org), specifically for research papers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science. Hugging Face users can submit their paper at hf.co/papers/submit, which features it on the Daily Papers feed (hf.co/papers). Each day, users can upvote papers and comment on papers. Each paper page allows authors to:
- claim their paper (by clicking their name on the `authors` field). This makes the paper page appear on their Hugging Face profile.
- link the associated model checkpoints, datasets and Spaces by including the HF paper or arXiv URL in the model card, dataset card or README of the Space
- link the Github repository and/or project page URLs
- link the HF organization. This also makes the paper page appear on the Hugging Face organization page.

Whenever someone mentions a HF paper or arXiv abstract/PDF URL in a model card, dataset card or README of a Space repository, the paper will be automatically indexed. Note that not all papers indexed on Hugging Face are also submitted to daily papers. The latter is more a manner of promoting a research paper. Papers can only be submitted to daily papers up until 14 days after their publication date on arXiv.

The Hugging Face team has built an easy-to-use API to interact with paper pages. Content of the papers can be fetched as markdown, or structured metadata can be returned such as author names, linked models/datasets/spaces, linked Github repo and project page.

## When to Use
- User shares a Hugging Face paper page URL (e.g. `https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08025`)
